# Image-Classification-with-CNN-RF

Our goal is to implement fruit recognition using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) (keras and OpenCV) by training the Fruits 360 dataset available on kaggle. We aim to develop a feature extraction technique with convolutional neural networks. On extracted features (with CNN), random forest classifier is used to classify the images. By applying this model to images captured using front camera, fruits can be predicted.
